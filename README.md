## DevRev Assignment

## Introduction
This is a Movies List Android app made for DevRev Interview screening, It consists of two screens. It follows the MVVM architecture and utilizes Retrofit for REST API calls, KOIN for Dependency Injection, and Lifecycle for Kotlin coroutines, and paging 3 for pagination and caching. Additionally, the app implements a Navigation Component from Jetpack to navigate between fragments
this app is using Network SDK https://github.com/adarsh-dhakad/Network_SDK
It improves the code readability as well as increases the hot build time significantly.

The app leverages modern technologies and follows best practices to ensure efficiency and maintainability. The major tech used in this project are:

- MVVM Architecture: Separating the app into layers of Model, View, and ViewModel to promote a clean and maintainable codebase.
- Retrofit: Handling REST API calls to retrieve and send data to the server.
- KOIN: Managing dependency injection to decouple classes and improve testability.
- Kotlin Coroutines with Lifecycle: Managing background tasks and asynchronous operations efficiently while respecting Android lifecycle.
- Navigation Component: Navigating between fragments in the app seamlessly.
- Sealed Classes: Handling generic responses and providing clear and consistent feedback to users.
- paging 3 for pagination and caching.
